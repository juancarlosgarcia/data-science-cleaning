# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 



## Running the script

- Clone this repository
- Download the [data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extract. It should result in a UCI HAR Dataset  folder that has all the files in the required structure.
- Change current directory to the folder where `UCI HAR Dataset` is located.
- Run `Rscript <path to>/run_analysis.R` 
- The tidy dataset should get created in the current directory as `tidy.txt`


## Assumptions

- The training and test data are available in folders named `train` and `test` respectively.
- For each of these data sets:
    - Measurements are present in `X_<dataset>.txt` file
    - Subject information is present in `subject_<dataset>.txt` file
    - Activity codes are present in `y_<dataset>.txt` file
- All activity codes and their labels are in a file named `activity_labels.txt`.
- Names of all measurements taken are present in file `features.txt` ordered and indexed as they appear in the `X_<dataset>.txt` files.
- All columns representing means contain `...mean()` in them.
- All columns representing standard deviations contain `...std()` in them.
